## Current Objectives

- Implement the "Clients" page functionality and view.

## Context

- The Home page is complete and rendering correctly.
- Header and footer elements are managed via partials.
- The next section to develop according to the roadmap is the "Clients" page. This involves displaying information about past clients or employment history.

## Next Steps

1.  **Controller:** Ensure `ClientsController.php` exists in `app/controllers/` and inherits from `BaseController`. Create an `index` method to handle the main clients page request.
2.  **View:** Create the view file `app/views/clients/index.php`. Structure the basic HTML for the clients page content. Include the main layout which pulls in the header and footer partials.
3.  **Routing:** Verify the `Router` (`app/core/Router.php`) can correctly route requests like `/clients` to the `ClientsController@index` method. Add a route if necessary.
4.  **(Optional) Model:** If client data needs to be dynamic (fetched from a database), create a `Client.php` model in `app/models/` inheriting from `BaseModel`. Implement methods to fetch client data. Update the `ClientsController` to use this model.
5.  **Styling:** Add necessary CSS rules to `public/css/main.css` for the clients page layout and elements.
