### 2. **Hosting Structure Preparation**
- **Problem**: Site needed professional shared hosting deployment structure
- **Solution**: Created secure hosting architecture separating public and private files
- **Structure Created**:
  ```
  hosting-structure/
  ├── private_files/        # Secure, outside web root
  │   ├── app/             # Application code

## 🛠️ **Files Created/Modified**

### **New Files Created**:
```
CLAUDE.md
migrate.php (CLI tool)
docs/session-summary-2025-01-28.md

hosting-structure/ (local only - not pushed to GitHub)
├── private_files/
│   ├── app/config/ (environment configs)
│   ├── app/core/ (MigrationManager, SharedHostingSecurity)
│   ├── database/migrations/ (6 migration files)
│   ├── database/seeds/ (3 seed files)
│   └── .htaccess (protection files)
└── public_html/ (updated index.php, migrate.php, .htaccess)
```

### **Git Ignore Configuration**:
The `hosting-structure/` folder contains production-ready files with sensitive configurations and is intentionally excluded from GitHub pushes via `.gitignore` to prevent:
- Database credentials exposure
- Production passwords in version control  
- Hosting-specific configuration leaks

**Note**: Files remain locally version controlled for development tracking but are not pushed to remote repository.
